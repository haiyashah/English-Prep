As cities grow larger and their populations increase, they tend to lose their charm. I completely agree that accommodating too many inhabitants leads to a loss of a city’s appeal due to the erosion of culture and the rise of pollution.
One significant consequence of large populations in cities is the loss of culture. When people from various places and different ethnic backgrounds move to a new city, they are often unaware of its unique culture. Most of these people relocate in search of better career opportunities rather than to embrace the local culture. Bengaluru exemplifies this phenomenon. Known as the city of immigrants due to the tech boom in the 2000s, the original residents, or Bangalorites, have become so sparse that the city’s culture and ancestral traditions are being lost.
Another side-effect of a large influx of immigrants is pollution. Cities are designed to support a specific number of people. When the population exceeds this limit, it can lead to severe air pollution, traffic congestion, and over-utilization of resources. This issue is evident in Bombay, where overpopulation due to the Bollywood industry has forced poor people to live in overcrowded chawls. These accommodations often house around 20 people in a space meant for far fewer, creating unsustainable living conditions.
In conclusion, it is evident that cities lose their charm when they become overpopulated. This can result in significant issues such as the loss of long-celebrated cultures and traditions, and detrimental health effects due to increased pollution.

In some areas, obesity is considered an acute health problem. While some blame junk food advertisements for it and say that they should be prohibited, others don’t think that is the main reason for obesity. The first view follows the school of thought that people get misguided because advertisements show junk food as a delicious and healthy meal. The second view believes that if someone is careful about their health, no advertisement can persuade them to eat junk food.
When people see junk food advertisements, they get the thought of trying them. Then, when they repeatedly see in ads that consuming them is highly pleasurable, their thought turns into a desire, to which they ultimately give in, and spoil their health. I disagree with this viewpoint because ads merely tell a lie of how junk food is good, which we all know is bad, and if someone falls for them, it is the person’s fault. The 2-minute noodles ad is a perfect example for this. The ad made the noodles look tasty and claimed that it has vitamins and nutrient values, which led to a huge customer base, although it was false advertising.
The second viewpoint states that ads cannot be blamed for obesity because they do not force people to consume junk food. They are merely a suggestion, and most people who are aware that junk food is unhealthy always have the choice to stay away from it. One cannot say junk food ads are responsible for obesity, because sportsmen and other fit people see the same ads but choose to not fall for it. I completely agree with this viewpoint because we cannot blame our surroundings for our bad health. It is a choice we make. For instance, Coca-Cola is a drink that makes a fortune just by selling sugar water. However, in a video, when the famous footballer Cristiano Ronaldo rejected a Coca-Cola bottle and requested water instead, Coca-Cola's stocks went down and people realized that they cannot be influenced by fancy advertising. It is a person’s choice to be healthy and the right habits and choices matter, not the ads.
In conclusion, some people believe that advertisements of junk food are a huge factor in the number of obese people today, while others feel that the ads are not to be blamed. It is a choice without the influence of any ad that a person makes when they consume junk food. I believe that the second stance makes sense and people should focus on building the correct habits and a healthy lifestyle rather than banning ads.

As the population of cities increases and they get larger, they lose their charm. I completely agree that an influx of too many inhabitants leads to losing a city’s appeal due to the loss of culture and the rise in pollution.
Big cities with a high number of residents per capita face a loss of culture. When people from different places and ethnicities move to a new city, they are mostly unaware of its culture. People often relocate for better career opportunities, rather than an interest in integrating into the local traditions and customs. Bengaluru is an example of this. It became a city of immigrants due to the 2000s tech hub boom, and sadly, the original Bangaloreans are now so sparse that the city’s culture and ancestral traditions have been lost.
Another side-effect of a large number of immigrants is pollution. Cities are built and designed to support only a certain number of people. When this limit is exceeded, it can lead to air pollution, traffic jams, and over-utilization of resources. This phenomenon is seen in Bombay, where the city became overpopulated due to the Bollywood culture. As a result, many poor people had to reside in overcrowded Chawls, with about 20 people in a house, far exceeding sustainable living conditions.
In conclusion, it is true that cities lose their appeal when many outsiders come to live in them. This can lead to pressing issues like the loss of culture and traditions that had been celebrated for years, and it is also harmful to the health of the citizens due to increased pollution.

Governments lend lots of financial support to artists, but some say that this is not the best investment for the country. The first viewpoint supports that creative professionals get sponsored from the government as this will help them improve their work and take the country ahead. The second viewpoint argues that better investments could be made in fields such as education, which is crucial for a country’s development.
Artists such as singers and actors are heftily supported by funds from the government. The money allows them to perform on bigger platforms and become an international sensation which could demonstrate the country’s culture. I disagree with this viewpoint because I feel that a nation should focus on solving its most striking problems first like educating everyone at least until 18 years. Singers like Sunidhi Chauhan are financially sponsored by the government to entertain people in national events and world stages. This will definitely make India get a high reputation.
The counter argument states that the government shouldn’t spend so much money on supporting artists, rather there are bigger problems to be solved first. The government must remember that development happens when it invests its resources in providing the at least the minimum needs to all citizens, and then sponsoring to artistic stars. I agree with this. The government is getting taxes for the country’s development which starts by providing the right resources to every village. Sponsoring artists in a developed country like USA, is acceptable because almost 90% of its population highly educated and does not have a crisis of needs. In country like India, where 40% of the students don’t study beyond the age of 14 years, investing most of the government’s funds in education is more important.
While one group thinks that governments are right when they spend a large sum of money in helping artists grow, the other believes that the government should focus on urgent problems that need to be addressed before, such as educating all. I agree with this, because ‘needs’ should be prioritized over ‘wants’. Education is a ‘need’, and unless all the children are not educated at least till the age of 18, no investment should go into ‘wants’ like artistic growth and performance.

While some feel that violence shown in the fictitious world such as movies and fiction books doesn’t affect anyone negatively, others believe that it leads to violence. The former say that humans should have their own discretion towards fiction and understand it is shown purely for entertainment, however the latter argue that people get influenced by seeing fictional violence, especially if their favourite character is glorifying it, and attempt to do so in real life.
When a person watches fiction, he understands what he is watching is fake. Hence, he’ll watch it with an open mind, without bringing feelings or intelligence into it. That violence documentary will not affect him or bring any violence in his behaviour because he understands it is wrong, and is watching it merely for pleasure. I disagree with this viewpoint because movies and fiction are so realistic nowadays that people get influenced by them, despite knowing about its truth. Movies such as Animal is full of violence and misogynistic characters. People who watch it for the first time, might get under the impression that is the right way to behave with girls, which is absolutely wrong and horrifying.
The opposite viewpoint argues that films, no matter how alert we are about their artificial nature, always leave an impression in our minds and change a part of our way of thinking. This could either be because of a good storyline, or good acting or good directing. Hence, we should not watch fiction that shows anything destructive, as it may leave an impact in our minds, even unknowingly.
I agree with this view because I believe that we learn what we see and hear, and fiction most of the time looks so realistic, that our mind cannot really differentiate between real and reel. Hence, we might end up taking away some lessons from the fictional movies or books that are no way related to real life. Aamir Khan is one of the all time favourite actor of the youth of our nation. When his movie had come out where he was cat-calling a girl on the road, a lot of his blind followers repeated the same in actual streets and tried to even harass women because they believed that if their hero is doing it in the film, if they do it too, they will be a hero too for all the girls. This wholly untrue and the sad reality is that humor was misinterpreted in such a negative way.
Hence, although one group of people feel fictional violence portrayed on television is harmless because people know that it is just merely for entertainment, another group of people feel that it is harmful and can convert people into becoming more violent in real time. I agree with the latter view because I also am a firm believer that we learn from whatever we see, even after knowing it is fake, hence one should stay away from violence television series

Some companies enforce dress codes requiring employees to wear uniforms at all times. This policy brings both advantages and disadvantages worth considering.
On the positive side, uniformity in attire fosters a sense of belonging among employees. When all staff wear the same uniform, such as the blue uniforms worn by Zolo Hospitality's room cleaning staff, it creates a cohesive identity and reinforces dedication to the company's goals. Employees feel united with their colleagues and the organization, which enhances teamwork and commitment.
However, there are drawbacks to mandating a standard uniform. One significant disadvantage is the potential discomfort it can cause. Uniforms may not be suitable or comfortable for everyone, especially in diverse climates like India where traditional formal wear, often adopted from cooler Western climates, can be impractical and uncomfortable. For instance, many Indian employees express discomfort with formal attire in hot weather and prefer traditional clothing that suits their climate and personal preferences.
Allowing employees to choose their attire could mitigate these issues. Allowing flexibility in dress code not only respects individual comfort and cultural preferences but also supports employee morale and productivity. When employees are comfortable in their attire, they are likely to be happier and more productive in their roles.
In conclusion, while uniforms can enhance unity and identity within a company, they may also lead to discomfort and dissatisfaction among employees. The optimal solution may lie in offering employees the choice between wearing company uniforms or dressing in attire that aligns with their comfort and cultural preferences. This approach can promote both unity and individual satisfaction in the workplace, contributing to a positive and productive work environment.

Many people are now opting to provide technology companies with their personal data in exchange for access to software. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?
A lot of people are choosing to give access to their personal data in return for using their software. The advantage of this is that they will get to use the proprietary software, but it is at the cost of their sensitive information, hence it is not worth it.
Nowadays, as the use technology has become so common, people have started trusting random websites with their personal data. They believe that no one will misuse it and because everyone is willing to share their details, if I also share mine, no harm happen. For example, there is a website that scans documents to extract text from images using OCR scanner. People are even willing to scan sensitive documents like aadhar card in such scanners to extract their details.
However, there is a massive disadvantage to this, which outweighs the advantage. The down side is that your sensitive data is now out in the public, and anyone can misuse it. One might feel that in exchange of my information, I’ll get to use the software, but that bargain is not worth it, because the software might not cost anything, but if your private data gets into the wrong hands, they can blackmail you and loot you with an overwhelming sum of money.
Hence, it is always advised to not give out your sensitive information, especially bank or financial details to random sources, just for the sake of using a simple software, because this bargain, could could you a heftily in the future.

In modern times, children are spending less time with their families and more time with their friends. Why has this change occurred? Do you think parents should force their children to spend more time at home?
In recent days, kids spend much more time with their friends compared to their family. This change has occurred because technology has led to times changing rapidly and the gap is huge compared to any other generation gap before. I think kids should be given the choice to spend time with whoever they wise to, and parents should be more like friends than parents to their kids, to improve their bonding with them.
Children nowadays prefer freedom more than anything else, and with the increase in access to the internet, children are growing up faster than before. They do not like following instructions of their parents and prefer to live with their friends who let them be however they want to be. For example, parents normally ask their children to study for 6 hours a day and play for 2 hours a day, however, nowadays it’s possible to gain knowledge of 6 hours within 2 hours though YouTube, hence, kids feel their parents are unnecessarily forcing them to study more, and they opt to choose their own paths. Friends also prefer playing more. This is the freedom that kids are seeking and hence they prefer staying with their friends.
I don’t think parents should force their children to spend more time at home. In fact I want parents to treat their children as adults and make friends with them. By doing this, the kids will be able to open up and truly express his thoughts to them, like he would do to his friends. By doing so, parents would be able to guide their child as an experienced friend and also make sure that their children enjoys like how others of the same generation do. Hence the best way to bridge the gap is by having healthy friendly conversations with their children and make a balance which is suitable for both.
To conclude, children spend less time with their families because they don’t feel heard and understood like they feel with their friends. The best way to make both parents and their kids understand and help each other is by becoming friends and having conversations and making a decision that takes into account the views of both the generations.

Nowadays, people love exploring places more than ever before because of the easy and cheap access to transportation. The advantages of travelling for a traveller is taking a break from mundane life and learning from other places and their native people’s lives. 
Previously, people did not have an option to travel around the world because of the lack of accessibility of flights in their locality. Even if it was accessible, majority of the people could not afford it because of its high prices. That’s why people used to stay in their hometown for most of their life. Nowadays, since transportation through vehicles like aeroplanes and trains is much cheaper and accessible, people have the option of moving to another country at an affordable price, hence, they take advantage of it and travel the world to satisfy their curiosity of knowing how the world it outside their hometown.
There are plenty benefits of travelling for the traveller. One such advantage is the ability to escape from their routine world, either to take a break or get a new perspective on life. People believe that when they travel, they are in a completely different environment, hence they get to learn a lot from the people of that country, their culture and their traditions. Another group of people feel that moving out gives an opportunity to grow as when one is out of his comfort zone, he learns how to face the challenges of life on his own and it leads to independence.
In conclusion, travelling has become much more affordable and accessible than before, hence travellers go out more often than before. It gives them a relaxing experience and fulfils their curiosity about the world outside their hometown, like learning new things such as the traditions of the place they travel to.
