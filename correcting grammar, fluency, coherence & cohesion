As cities grow larger and their populations increase, they tend to lose their charm. I completely agree that accommodating too many inhabitants leads to a loss of a city’s appeal due to the erosion of culture and the rise of pollution.

One significant consequence of large populations in cities is the loss of culture. When people from various places and different ethnic backgrounds move to a new city, they are often unaware of its unique culture. Most of these people relocate in search of better career opportunities rather than to embrace the local culture. Bengaluru exemplifies this phenomenon. Known as the city of immigrants due to the tech boom in the 2000s, the original residents, or Bangalorites, have become so sparse that the city’s culture and ancestral traditions are being lost.

Another side-effect of a large influx of immigrants is pollution. Cities are designed to support a specific number of people. When the population exceeds this limit, it can lead to severe air pollution, traffic congestion, and over-utilization of resources. This issue is evident in Bombay, where overpopulation due to the Bollywood industry has forced poor people to live in overcrowded chawls. These accommodations often house around 20 people in a space meant for far fewer, creating unsustainable living conditions.

In conclusion, it is evident that cities lose their charm when they become overpopulated. This can result in significant issues such as the loss of long-celebrated cultures and traditions, and detrimental health effects due to increased pollution.
