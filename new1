As the population of cities increases and they grow larger, they often lose their charm. I completely agree that an influx of too many inhabitants leads to the loss of a city’s appeal due to the erosion of culture and the rise in pollution.
Big cities with a high population density face a cultural decline. When people from different places and ethnicities move to a new city, they are often unaware of its culture. People typically relocate for better career opportunities rather than an interest in integrating into local traditions and customs. Bengaluru is an example of this. It became a city of immigrants due to the tech hub boom in the 2000s, and sadly, the original Bangaloreans are now so sparse that the city’s culture and ancestral traditions have been lost.
Another consequence of a large number of immigrants is pollution. Cities are built and designed to support only a certain number of people. When this limit is exceeded, it can lead to air pollution, traffic jams, and the over-utilization of resources. This phenomenon is seen in Bombay, where the city became overpopulated due to the Bollywood culture. As a result, many poor people had to reside in overcrowded chawls, with about 20 people in a house, far exceeding sustainable living conditions.
In conclusion, it is true that cities lose their appeal when many outsiders come to live in them. This can lead to pressing issues like the loss of culture and traditions that have been celebrated for years, and it is also harmful to the health of the citizens due to increased pollution.
