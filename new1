As cities grow in population and expand, they often lose their charm. I completely agree that an influx of too many inhabitants leads to a city's loss of appeal due to cultural erosion and increased pollution.
Large cities with a high population density often experience a decline in cultural heritage. When people from various places and ethnic backgrounds move to a new city, they are usually unaware of its culture. Many relocate for better career opportunities rather than a genuine interest in integrating into the local traditions and customs. Bengaluru exemplifies this. It became a city of immigrants due to the tech boom of the 2000s, and sadly, the original Bangaloreans are now so few that the cityâ€™s culture and ancestral traditions have been significantly diminished.
Another consequence of a large number of immigrants is pollution. Cities are designed to support only a certain number of people. When this limit is exceeded, it can lead to air pollution, traffic congestion, and over-utilization of resources. This phenomenon is evident in Bombay, where the city became overpopulated due to the Bollywood industry. Consequently, many impoverished people had to live in overcrowded chawls, with about 20 people in a house, far exceeding sustainable living conditions.
In conclusion, it is true that cities lose their appeal when many outsiders move in. This can lead to significant issues such as the loss of long-celebrated culture and traditions and harm the health of citizens due to increased pollution.
