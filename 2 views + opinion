In some areas, obesity is considered an acute health problem. While some blame junk food advertisements and believe they should be banned, others think that advertisements are not the main cause of obesity. The first view suggests that people are misguided by advertisements portraying junk food as delicious and healthy. The second view believes that health-conscious individuals are not swayed by such advertisements.

When people see junk food advertisements, they might be tempted to try these products. Repeated exposure to ads claiming high pleasure from consuming these foods can turn thoughts into desires, leading to unhealthy eating habits. I disagree with this viewpoint because advertisements only present a misleading image of junk food, which is widely known to be unhealthy. If someone falls for these ads, it is ultimately their responsibility. The 2-minute noodles ad is an example; it portrayed the noodles as nutritious, leading to a large customer base, despite being false advertising.

The opposing viewpoint argues that advertisements cannot be blamed for obesity as they do not force people to consume junk food. Ads are merely suggestions, and informed individuals have the choice to avoid them. This perspective highlights that athletes and other fit individuals see the same ads but choose to ignore them. I agree with this viewpoint because we cannot blame our environment for poor health choices. It is a personal responsibility to maintain healthy habits. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo rejected a Coca-Cola bottle in favor of water, it demonstrated that personal choices outweigh advertising influence.

In conclusion, while some believe junk food advertisements significantly contribute to obesity, others argue that personal choice plays a more critical role. I support the latter view, emphasizing the importance of building healthy habits over banning advertisements.
